# shortTextBasedAdventure
A short text-based adventure that should be about 5-10 minutes long. It should be easy to play and have a simple but intriguing story that pushes the player forward.

The game takes place in the andies, you wake up in immediate danger and have to act.

The game features a short introductory area in order to come to grips with the mechanics and then features three scenarios.
Each features a puzzle that also pushes the story forward. It is a mysterious adventure with inspirations from Indiana Jones and Memento.

It should be available in Swedish, English and German, something that should be chosen before starting the game.

**Testing strategy**

All the lower classes should be tested with JUnit. The bigger ones, like Game, could be tested by play-testing.
This means that a human tests the game and actively tries to break it. Bugs are then recorded and solved.
